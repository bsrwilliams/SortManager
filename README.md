## About The Project
This project contains implementations of the sorting algorithms Bubble sort, Merge sort, Quick sort and Binary Tree. Theses algorithms were developed using the Java programming language and includes the practice of many features.      

### Noteable features:
* JUNIT
* SOLID Principles
* ENUMS
* Nested Classes
* Exceptions
* Logging 

#### Bubble Sort
This simple sorting algorithm is a comparison based algorithm. Operating by comparing each element in a list to the adjacent element value to derive which element is out of order and swapping their positions. This algorithm continues until the whole list is ordered. Bubble sort is not suitable for large data sets as the average and worst case time complexity is O(n^2) - n is the size of the list. 


### Merge Sort
Merge sort is an algorithm based on the divide and conquer technique. Sorting a list by first dividing it into multiple single element lists, and then mergeing all lists in a sorted manner - hence Merge sort. Merge sort performs better than bubble sort when large data sets are involved, with a worst-case time complexity of O(n log n).  

### Quick Sort
Like Merge sort, the Quick sort algorithm is also a divide and conquer technique. Sorting a list by partitioning it into smaller lists. 

### Binary Tree

### Technologies:
- Java JDK 11
- JUNIT
- Maven
- IntelliJ
- Log4j
